# food_rec
This repo contains my work on building a food recommendation system. It's currently an ongoing project. I'll keep updating it.

## How to use
Currently, we have a preprocessing file for the ta-feng dataset. Since none of the previous work clearly mention the preprocessing steps, we reimplemented the steps to get the same User/Item distribution as they stated in their papers.
